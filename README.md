##OverView

This project is about performing my apility to collect, and work with, and clea a tidy data set.
A description of the data set is avialable at : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
And the data set being used for this project is : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Summary description
###Description of the Project instruction (5 steps)

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
